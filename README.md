# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
in this modern era of technology and science, there are lots of ways of finding disease in human body. And Scientist and researchers are trying to find the early stage of heart disease. Heart disease is the major cause of deaths worldwide. To give treatment for heart disease, a lot of advanced technologies are used. The most common problem in medical centres is that many medical personnel do not have equal knowledge and expertise in treating patients.as a result, they deduce their own. As a result of this decision, the outcome is dismal. It can also lead to death. To overcome above problem This research paper presents various attributes related to heart disease, and the model on basis of supervised learning algorithms, for developing this system Pandas logistic regression model is used and NumPy. It uses the existing dataset from the Cleveland database of UCI repository of heart disease patients. This research paper aims to determine the developing heart disease in the patients in Binary form.
